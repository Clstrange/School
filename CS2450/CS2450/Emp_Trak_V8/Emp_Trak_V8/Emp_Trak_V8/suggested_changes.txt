1.) Many fields can be left blank. From my testing, most of the fields
that are still required on the add new employee don't necessarily need
to be filled out just yet. An employee may not have an office phone 
set up yet, not have bank info yet, not have been given a title, etc.
2.) Certain fields like pay method, classification, and permission level
would be more user friendly and easily validated with dropdowns.
3.) Pop-up at bottom of screen that says not all fields are valid
probably would be more visable at the top.
4.) The alerts under each field that is required or needs attention
after validation should be styled red.
5.) If we deactive an employee, there should be a way to reactivate 
them as well.
6.) We may want to section off our view window from our nav bar on the 
left. Help to be more user friendly and guide the eyes of the user
better.

|  Nav  |          View        |

7.) Add a search list that can be dynamically filtered by the search
keys entered into the search bar. 
8.) We need to develop a read me txt file for the program.
9.) Have a filter for the pay type classification so that you cannot
enter the other pay type fields to avoid messing up payroll.
10.) Create notifications of some sort to let the user know that they 
had successfully processes timecards, receipts, and printed out payroll.
