Alright, I finally figured it out, it took me a lot of research but I finnally figured out how Bill Clinton got the 
results he did. There are a couple of things that i would like to state on this matter because it isn't very simple.

1. Republicans resided over more TOTAL JOBS during there terms in office. So if we are looking at the total number 
of people working then more people worked under Republicans than under Democrats.

2. Bill Clinton was referring to the amount of JOBS ADDED during democrats/republicans terms. He is correct
that there were more jobs added during the terms of Democrats than republicans.

3. Bill Clinton resided over nearly half of the Democrats jobs creation at 20 million. A valid reason for this
is because of the 1980-1990 inflation/recession that ended right around he entered office. This meant he was President at the end of a reccession which
would cause a giant inflation of jobs.

4. So yes Clinton isn't technically wrong, but his data makes it seem like Democrats had significantly higher employment and economies which 
his data doesn't technically support.
