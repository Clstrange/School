```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```
```{r}
SS<-read.csv("SleepStudy.csv", header = T)
head(SS)
names(SS)
```

1.	Examine the distribution of DAS scores. 
```{r}
hist(SS$DASScore)
```

The DASScores distribution is skewed to the right.


2.	Does stress level depend on the circadian preferences ( LarkOwl)? 
```{r}
Tab<-table(SS$LarkOwl, SS$Stress)
Pr<-prop.table(Tab, 1)
barplot(Pr, beside = T)
```

It seems that the sleep type is slightly related to the level of depression of a person. With being both a Lark or an Owl is associated with slightly higher levels of depression.

3.	Are cognitive skills and alcohol use related? 
```{r}
Al <-SS$AlcoholUse
Cog <-SS$CognitionZscore

boxplot(Cog~Al, horizontal = T)
```

Yes, the cognitive skills and alcohol use seem to be related.

4.	Are you a lark or an owl?
```{r}
Table<-table(SS$LarkOwl)
pr<-prop.table(Table)
pr
barplot(pr)
```

Most students are neither Lark nor Owl

5.	Calculate the z-score for DASS scores and identify outliers using based on z-scores (more than 2 or less than -2).
```{r}
xbar<-mean(SS$DASScore)
s<-sd(SS$DASScore)
z<-(SS$DASScore-xbar)/s
z[z< -2 | z>2]
```
There are 11 outliers and they are all a z score greater than 2

6.	Is there any effect of the DASS score on sleep quality? 
```{r}
plot(SS$DASScore, SS$PoorSleepQuality)
```

Yes there does seem to be an association between DASScore and sleep quality

7.	Build an appropriate model to predict sleep quality in terms of the DASS scores. How good is your model? 

```{r}
model<-lm(SS$PoorSleepQuality~SS$DASScore)
summary(model)
```
The model's standard error is around 2.6 so I would say that it is pretty good

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
